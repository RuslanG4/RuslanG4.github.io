    <h1 class="select" id="ass-head">Assassins</h1>
    <p id="assassin-para">
        Assasins are classified as characters with high mobilty and high damage. It is the Assassins job to pick out priority targets, kill them in an instant and get away without being harmed.<br />
        Assasins can vary from dagger weilding bounty hunters to Magic weilding demons, what groups them all together is their abilty to put you on a death timer in mere seconds.<br />
        These characters are usually the most popular but also the most difficult, only dedicated players truly master a Zed combination, or how to properly roam with Talon.<br />
        Some characters like Katarina on the other hand require minimal skill and return the same reward-forcing your enemy to yell at how unfair and unbalanced your kit is.

    <h1 class="select" id="fight-head">Fighters</h1>
    <p id="fighter-para">
        Fighters are a class that often balance both damage and the abilty to take damage. Unlike the glass cannons that are assasins, <br />
        Fighters can also take damage. This class is often labelled as a juggernaut, and some of our most popular fighters are characters like Urgot and Darius.<br />
        You should play a fighter if you like to dictate where the game goes, initiate fights and be feared by the enemy team. If your dream is to stick your axe,<br />
        your sword or just your bare fists into someones face and defeat them, then the fighter class is for you!

    <h1 class="select" id="mage-head">Mages</h1>
    <p id="mage-para">
        Mages use all things magical and mystical. Some mages rely on ancients ruins in order to cast the most powerful spells, others call upon their demonic  powers to bring down a swarm of crows.<br />
        Mages utilise abilty power in order to maximise their damage output, most mages have a lower amount of health than fighters but they fight from a safer distance as most mages are  ranged.<br />
        If you choose the warlock class in other games and enjoy blasting your enemies with powerful magic then the mage class if for you, not a fan of ranged mages? not to worry, there are mixes!<br />
        There is a range of assassin mages and fighter mages and some of the most popular champions include Syndra, Viktor and Diana.

    <h1 class="select" id="tank-head">Tanks</h1>
    <p id="tank-para">
        Tanks are the combination of the unstopable force and the immovable object, a moving train heading in your direction that you have no hope of stopping.<br />
        You play a Tank if you want to soak up every bit of damage that the enemy team has and walk out with barely a scratch on you. Assassins killing you mages?<br />
        No problem, you're here to protect your team from those pesky Assassins by stunning them, knocking them up or immobilizing them - nothing gets inbetween you and your friends<br />
        This role is designed for the team player who wants to deal less damage but live longer and be unkillable, There is no better feeling than helping your team succeed<br />a
        and knowing they would be no where without you. Some of the most popular tanks include, Alistar-an angry Minotaur or Nautilus-A sea guardian who wont think twice about drowning you.

    <h1 class="select" id="marksmen-head">Marksmen</h1>
    <p id="marks-para">
        Marksmen are the definition of a glass cannon, they deal heavy damage but explode on impact. Similar to Assassins, they have minimal health but unlike Assassins they have a range advantage.<br />
        The job of a marksman isn't easy-your main goal is to farm up money in order to carry your team to victory, your early game is slow and tedious, you may feel like you do nothing.<br />
        But as soon as the game gets going, you start to shred your enemies and soon enough everyone begins to fear you. Marksmen or as the players call them ADC's have some of the most popular champions.<br />
        Champions like Jinx, Miss Fortune and KaiSa. But not all marksmen are ADCs, champions like Urgot are classified as marksmen but are also fighters-or what the community calls "Bruiser".<br />
        If dealing damage at a range and killing your opponents is what's calling your name then Marksmen are for you<br />

    <h1 class="select" id="supp-head">Supports</h1>
    <p id="supp-para">
        You are a Healer, you are a defender, you wish you buff your team, heal them when they're low and take the damage in order to protect your comrades. This is the job of a support player-to protect<br />
        Supports come in many different forms, some focus on healing and buffing but lean in to more of a mage style, others stun and take damage so your damage dealers don't have to, they lean towards the tank style<br />
        But one thing all supports have in common is the abilty to save your team. You might be the reason for winnig a teamfight-not many people notice that because of your healing they are alive, but that's okay for you<br />
        You enjoy sitting in the backline and having others works for you-You are the most valuable part of the team. Some of the most popular supports include Taric-an aspect of a mountain and the most stylish man in the game.<br />
        Morgana-a fallen angel who uses dark magic to insnare you or Zilean-an old man that can control time.<br />
