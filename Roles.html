    <h1 class="headings" id="top">Top Lane</h1>
    <p class="text" id="top-para">
        Due to the priority of Dragon, this position tends to remain isolated from the rest of the team.<br />
        Ideal champions for this position are largely self-sufficient with tools to dominate in duels,<br />
        scale by farming, or impact the map in other ways.
    </p>
    <h1 class="headings" id="jungle">Jungle</h1>
    <p class="text" id="jungle-para">
        This position provides a safe avenue to obtain gold and experience through jungle camps, without much interference from opponents.<br />
        Due to camps being spread out across the map, the player can freely path around the map to influence lanes and secure objectives.
    </p>
    <h1 class="headings" id="mid">Mid Lane</h1>
    <p class="text" id="mid-para">
        The middle lane provides the fastest income of gold and experience due to its short distance. <br />
        The lane's smaller space is also attractive for champions with bad defense to easily retreat to safety under turret.<br />
        Being in the center of the map, this position has easy access to other sectors similar to the Jungler.
    </p>
    <h1 class="headings" id="adc">ADC</h1>
    <p class="text" id="adc-para">Due to the priority of Dragon, the Support tends to prioritize control of this lane over others. <br />
    Ideal champions for Bottom position can optimize the presence of the Support throughout the laning phase.</p>
    <h1 class="headings" id="support">Support</h1>
    <p class="text" id="support-para">The support position tends to take a passive approach to gold generation in favor of funneling the active income to other positions.<br />
        The player would instead succeed primarily through providing security or kill potential for their team. <br />
    This objective is best executed in a side lane due to the close proximity to the opponents and wide area being hard for them to escape from.</p>
