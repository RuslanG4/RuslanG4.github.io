    <h1 id="about">ABOUT</h1>
    <p class="text" id="game-info">
        League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other’s base.<br />
        Choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory.<br />
        The Nexus is the heart of both teams’ bases. Destroy the enemy’s Nexus first to win the game.

    <h1 id="world-head">THE WORLD</h1>
    <p class="text" id="world-info">
        The League of Legends Universe is split into many different territories, each with a unique identity and history behind it.<br />
        The world has a story to relate to almost anyone! Are you a thrill seeking adventurer who loves to sail the seven seas, then Bilgewater is for you.<br />
        Are you a knight looking to serve a king and expand your mighty empire, You my friend are a Demacian. Fancy a desert of sand - that's Shurima.
        <br />Do you strive for technological prowess or want to rule the under-belly of a city where all sorts of characters appear, then take a visit to Piltover and Zaun.<br />
        Perhaps a viking living in the tundra worshipping the old gods, or a half animal protecting nature, maybe your a shadow demon hell bent on destroying the world!<br />
        The point is the world is so fast and full of life, there is never a place where you are bored, and wioth over 140 characters in the game each with a unique lore,<br />
        There is no such reading up you can do!

    <h1 id="lore-example">SIGNED LORE</h1>
    <p class="text" id="singed-lore">
        This is an example of one of my favourite characters.<br />
        Singed is a Zaunite alchymist of unmatched intellect, who has devoted his life to pushing the boundaries of knowledge—with no price, even his own sanity, too high to pay.<br />
        Is there a method to his madness? His concoctions rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake.
